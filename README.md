### Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning course

I'm currently following the course [Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://dbourke.link/pt-github) by Daniel Bourke. I used Google Collab's Jupyter Notebooks to take notes of the lessons. All lessons can be found in the [pytorch-course](/pytorch-course) folder.

*Lesson* contains the name of the lesson or activity done, *Content* the materials/resources created in that activity, and *Description* gives a brief summary of that activity.

### Python Notes

Throughout my learning, I'm discovering better/more efficient ways to code in Python, as well as good practices to have while coding with the language. Resources like those will be located in the [python-notes](/python-notes/) folder.

### Models

Some materials require building one or more models. All models for every lesson can be found in the [models](/models/) folder.

## PthFunctions

A [library](https://github.com/Yer-Marti/PthFunctions) containing useful packages and functions for PyTorch development.

## External resources

These are resources that I found useful while learning and developing Machine Learning:
