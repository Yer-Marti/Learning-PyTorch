## About the models

In PyTorch, models are named with `.pth` or `.pt` extensions. The naming convention followed for the models used in this course is the following:

`##_name_of_lesson_model_X.pth` - Where `##` is the number of the lesson and `X` the number/name given to the model in the lesson.

E.g. `01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth` is the 0th model of the 1st lesson with name PyTorch Workflow.
